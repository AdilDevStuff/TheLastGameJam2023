This project might be abandoned by me. or i might come to this later on in the future.
Started this originally for **Last Game 2023 Jam**

Decided to open source this as i might not complete it. So if anyone wants to make
something like a space themed tower defense then you can use this as a base

**NOTE:**
The code in this one might not be good or efficient as im a noob making games as a hobby.
It just works! And the project is half cooked

Enemies doesn't do anything other then go from A to B and die when player unit shoots bullet
at them. The major part of this one is the build system. I think its actually cool.

You can use any part of this project in ur games....good luck making your games!
Peace!
